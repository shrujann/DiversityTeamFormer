    "- Tasked to develop an algorithm that organise students into diverse and balanced teams for a data science course at NTU\n",

    "- The course has **6,000** students spread across **120** tutorial groups\n",

    "Team composition:\n",
    "- Each team should have **5** students \n",
    "\n",
    "Criteria for team formation:\n",
    "1. **CGPA:** Teams should not consist predominantly of students with very high or very low CGPAs\n",
    "2. **Gender:** Teams should not have a majority of students of the same gender\n",
    "3. **School affiliation:** Teams should not have a majority of students from the same school"

    "## Overview\n",
    "Data Categorization: \n",
    "- Used key attributesâ€”School, CGPA, and Gender. \n",
    "- Created 120 lists, each with 50 dictionaries. \n",
    "- Added students to groups while continuously checking for validity to maintain balance \n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing Gender Diversity: \n",
    "- Targeted an approximate gender ratio of 60% female to 40% male in each team. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring CGPA Balance: \n",
    "- Calculated the average CGPA for each group.\n",
    "- Ensured the mean CGPA of each team fell within an acceptable range (e.g., 4.0 to 4.4 if the overall mean is 4.2). \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation Function: \n",
    "- Optimized team formation by minimizing the standard deviation of CGPA across teams. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grouping Process:\n",
    "- Systematically processed the dataset to form teams one by one. \n",
    "- Refined groups iteratively until all 120 teams were complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Edge Cases:\n",
    "- Started with strict criteria and gradually relaxed them to ensure feasible team allocations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome: \n",
    "- Balanced diversity and fairness effectively through this structured methodology.\n"
