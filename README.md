# ðŸš€ SC1003 Diversity Team Former (Mini-Project)

The goal of this project is to automate the formation of student groups using CSV data that includes each studentâ€™s GPA, gender, faculty, and tutorial group. The system organizes students into groups of five within each tutorial, aiming for balanced average GPAs, andâ€”where possibleâ€”ensures that no group has more than three members of the same gender or faculty.
