# 🚀 SC1003 Diversity Team Former (Mini-Project)

The goal of this project is to automate the formation of student groups using CSV data that includes each student’s GPA, gender, faculty, and tutorial group. The system organizes students into groups of five within each tutorial, aiming for balanced average GPAs, and—where possible—ensures that no group has more than three members of the same gender or faculty.
